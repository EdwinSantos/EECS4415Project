1576426393,It seems there is always a Turn on  button when we play Top teamsAnd a Turn off button against Mid/Lower teams\ud83d\ude12We shouldn't be dropping points like this any longer if we want a Top 4 finish\ud83d\ude1eGGMU tho\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc9d#MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426393,"If martial doesn't put in good performances, he'll soon be replaced by greenwood#MUNEVE",#MUNEVE
1576426394,The only good thing that Lingard did today was getting subbed off for Greenwood.#MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426395,"Martial should remove that number 9 shirt please, he is not even close to a 9.#MUNEVE",#MUNEVE
1576426398,#MUNEVE What was wrong about today's game,#MUNEVE
1576426399,Nice game but not happy with the \ud83c\udf88\u26bd\u26bd\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f result #MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426402,"This Utd side, never consistent #MUNEVE",#MUNEVE
1576426404,these yer ders are a joke... why do they always have to act like black people are the problem just because they don't know how to deal with one personally? #MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426417,I don't think Moise deserved that treatment #MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426418,Big Dunc rightly took off Keane. Wasn't running and working hard enough despite being told.#MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426419,".@ManUtd That was a frustrating game to watch \ud83d\ude15 we seem to struggle to break down teams that sit back against us and flourish when they come to attack. Still, the team is progressing so that\u2019s positive #MUNEVE #GGMU",#MUNEVE
1576426419,Too many players weren't at their best today and that cost us. Lingard had an absolute shocker. Poor distribution and control. Unfortunately this is just the way we'll be this season. I expect more poor results at home against teams that defend. Much more confident away #MUNEVE,#MUNEVE
1576426424,"#MUNEVE A trend is now established. United are able to execute their favoured counter attack against front foot teams - but struggle against those teams that are more defensively minded. Solksjaer, the coaching staff and players look increasingly like one trick ponies.",#MUNEVE

1576426425,Okay so Moise Kean seemingly ignored his manager\u2019s instruction to track a Man United player. Ferguson wouldn\u2019t have that so decided to set an example. Fair?#MUNEVE #MUFC,#MUNEVE
1576426426,"This isn't a dig at Greenwood btw, he's got the makings of a very good player. It's the media overhyping another young English player too soon, and fans comparing him to one of the most gifted players of the 21st century when he's been on the scene for 5 minutes #MUNEVE",#MUNEVE
