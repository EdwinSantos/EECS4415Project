1576421926,Juan Mata might be more usefull now when Everton will sit back but I hope Ole won't sub Lingard off on his bday #MUFC,#MUFC
1576421929,"Only positive thing from the first half was Luke Shaws performance, Maguire and Lindel\u00f6f getting bullied, Lingard and James aren\u2019t even there today, feel a bit bad for Fred and McTomminay in midfield have nothing to work with, massive keep the arse needed at halftime #MUFC",#MUFC
1576421929,Shaw providing a reminder of just how poor he is. Williams has to be smashing that door down now for the left back spot. #MUFC,#MUFC
1576421930,Poor half but missed chances. Lingard &amp; James should have really scored. Would have been 1 or 2-0 before Everton goal. #MUFC,#MUFC
1576421931,Played quite a good half to be 0-1 down. But Shaw was poor. And De Gea has to be stronger there. We always make the costly error in these games and give the goal away. The front 3 and midfield 2 been really good. Lingard pressed well but should have finished. #MUFC #MUNEVE,#MUFC
1576421934,What's wrong with #MUFC I swear we have no quality expect for sitting back and counter-attacking.Need creative players.,#MUFC
1576421935,"I've done a complete 180 on VAR for anything other than offside (and even then I'm not convinced). It's a complete joke, run by refs that flip flop on their interpretation of the rules on a weekly basis. How is that not a foul on De Gea? Crap goalkeeping, but a clear foul. #MUFC",#MUFC

1576421947,"We weren't completely poor 1st half, hope we carry on with a little of creativity in the final third &amp; take our chances, De gea was clearly obstructed and it's a foul but the own goal has made the difference now we have to turn up in 2nd half &amp; get 3 points #MUFC #MUNEVE https://t.co/hEUVMDZJ44",#MUFC
1576421952,#MUFC Halftime a goal down isn\u2019t the worry it has been. We\u2019ve got goals in us. The defence needs to sort itself out this 2nd half. But still think we can do em. C\u2019mon UTD!,#MUFC
1576421953,"I don't like to criticize just for criticism sake, but Luke Shaw seems to have regressed. He doesn't offer much going forward, and he constantly allows his man WAY too much space defensively.I'd rather Williams - or even Young - start ahead of him going forward.#MUFC #MUNEVE",#MUFC
1576421958,"Even Souness has said its a foul. If that\u2019s a goal because the ref missed it, fair enough. But there is a clear hand in the face of the Keeper. Every time it goes to VAR I have no idea what their outcome will be. #VAR #MUFC",#MUFC

1576422047,Everton grew momentum later on in the 1st half &amp; the goal was coming for them.

De Gea should of done better for Everton goal. #MUFC #HJ,#MUFC
1576422047,The logic of De Gea not being strong enough or commanding as if that determines if a foul deserves to be called or not is really ridiculous. It's either a foul or not. And if you're ok to say that a guy can put his arms on a goalkeeper's face then I guess it's not a foul...#MUFC,#MUFC

1576425610,"Another big problem for #MUFC is that they have no one to break down tight defences. That little of nous &amp; finesse when teams are tight.

1576425633,Yet again.. Dropping point against lower tabled sides. James needs shooting practise too. #MUFC,#MUFC
1576425634,2 points dropped @ManUtd .We need reinforcements in Jan to make the most of this domination vs teams that let us have the possession.

1576425639,"To put things in perspective, we have taken 7 points from Spurs City and Everton. Mason is growing, we lack quality in attacking midfield especially in games like this. Fred played so well again. I think there are a lot of positives. And I belive in the process. #MUFC",#MUFC

1576426348,There\u2019s the problem... put an out and out striker in there and you get a couple of goals from the 26 shots. Plenty of chances to be had. But know one to take them. #MUFC,#MUFC
1576426348,Pretty sure Aaron Wan-Bissaka has legs longer than any lass I\u2019ve ever seen. What a player #MUFC,#MUFC
1576426352,@TheElitePundit @RichieKimbumina Talent alone is not going to cut it anymore. Martial has had plenty of opportunities to become the striker a club like Utd deserves but doesn't have anywhere near the consistency to be the main man. #MUFC #EPL #ManUtd,#MUFC
1576426353,@reshmikasingh Yup and.. We need a number 10 more than any thing for now! Pogba can do world of good for this side #MUFC,#MUFC
1576426354,At this I can confirm that @ManUtd is highly allergic to Top 4 #MUFC,#MUFC
1576426354,"@UnitedRedscom True say mate\ud83d\udc4alet Haaland in &amp; Bruno Fernandez &amp;I recommend OLE to start MASON over Martial, I love Martial but he has failed to raise up his passion for the game \ud83d\ude2d#MUFC",#MUFC
1576426363,greenwood should be starting the match a natural goal scorer. got slightest of a chance and he put that ball into the net.#MUFC,#MUFC
1576426363,"Fuck Giggs, fuck @IanWright0 saying Martial isn't holding the ball up. I usually rate Wright but he's joined stupid manutd legends in talking trash. Lingard was so poor, Martial had to drop deep cos we weren't creating, lingard can't fuckin control a ball let alone create #MUFC",#MUFC
1576426371,Should\u2019ve won that today very frustrating in the end 2 points dropped #United #MUFC,#MUFC
1576426373,"Greenwood needs to start now instead of Lingard, He made a massive impact when he came on and another good goal #MUFC #MasonGreenwood",#MUFC
1576426373,"Everton 1-1 (over 20 attempts on goal)Villa 2-2 (was winning 2-1)Sheffield united 3-3 (was winning 3-2)6 points dropped, we'd be 1 point behind city right now if we took our chances and saw games out.Dont sit here and tell me ole is the problem!!! #MUFC #MUNEVE",#MUFC
1576426375,"@SkySportsPL @GNev2 right to question the character of this #MUFC: defend Spurs &amp; City pressure easily, crumble against Everton, Villa, Sheff Utd etc. How!? They're like a glorified cup team that can only get up for the glamour ties. As a great man once said: 'They're cheating their manager!'",#MUFC
1576426376,@AnthonyMartial you have to do better on the pitch. For 10K I will leave my balls to score a goal or more at Old Trafford playing as a striker. You do absolute fuck all but always got you hands in the air when play breaks down. #MUFC,#MUFC

1576426399,"Martial, had just 34 touches and only 1 inside the box in the full 90 mins. Baines came on as a first half sub and had more touches in the first half than Martial did, We're a young team that can't afford to carry any passengers. His place is under threat from Greenwood. #MUFC",#MUFC
1576426402,"Rashford, Martial &amp; Lingard were awful today. James is redundant when a team defends deep. Should\u2019ve got Mata &amp; Greenwood on from half time #MUFC",#MUFC
