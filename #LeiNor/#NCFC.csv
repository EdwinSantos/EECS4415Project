1576339282,Much better half than anticipated. Scoring when on top has eluded #NCFC at crucial moments but the opener was deserved. Conceding to a set piece is depressingly predictable though. Like last week LCFC will improve after the break. If we start slow again then the game will be over,#NCFC
1576339435,A good insight into Maddison that half and how the mask slips from time to time. Puts the free kick out and shows good sportsmanship. Then leaves a horrible one on Tettey (a player he knows and likes) after an innocuous coming together. #NCFC,#NCFC
