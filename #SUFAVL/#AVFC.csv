1576338785,We shouldn\u2019t be playing Grealish on the LW either we haven\u2019t got a creative central midfielder players like Hourihane &amp; Lansbury ain\u2019t cutting it. Grealish should be in midfield next to McGinn with El Ghazi &amp; Trezeguet on the wings. #AVFC,#AVFC
1576338792,"Same old villa not creating anything and constantly on the back foot, no players around Wesley even if he was to win it. HAUSE SOLID\ud83d\ude4f#AVFC",#AVFC
1576338795,Not a fan of playing like this. All it takes is one moment of stupidity and we're getting nothing from the game. United aren't making errors whereas we've looked scruffy at times. Can't see anything other than a loss when the inevitable second half collapse comes #AVFC #optimism,#AVFC
1576338797,"Bit of a dull affair so far, defence have looked solid though which is nice and Hause has done a great job coming in for Mings. Big second half ahead, need to turn things up a bit #SHUAVL #AVFC",#AVFC

1576338892,"@AVFCFansForum Grealish needs to get further up to be a threat in that position, but he has to counter their fullback loving to get up. A bit between a rock and a hard place. #AVFC",#AVFC

1576338927,"All the talk about the need for a new striker in Jan (granted, we do) however the obvious area of improvement for me is our lack of pace. We have 0. No one running in behind at the moment and it\u2019s hindering us tenfold. #AVFC",#AVFC

1576338993,1st half summary.Hause &amp; Engels have been rock solid. Hause especially outstanding. We cant string 3 passes together.McGinn &amp; El Ghazi have been poor.Targett is just woeful.Grealish is wasted on the left. Wesley? Is he on the pitch? Plus side. We\u2019re not losing. #AVFC,#AVFC
1576339001,Why is McGinn still starting?? I love the guy but he's been muck the last 4 games at least nobody should be guaranteed a spot no matter their form not even him #AVFC,#AVFC
1576339031,Average first half. Can\u2019t keep the ball for more than 10 seconds. Wesley\u2019s touch is like an elephants. Everything just bounces off him. Hopefully Mcginn can start playing well in the second half. Two centre halves doing alright. #COYVB #VTID #AVFC #partofthepride #SHUAVL,#AVFC
